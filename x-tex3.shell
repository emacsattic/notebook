This is just to see how notebook-to-tex works.  Do try to run this.


>>dog=$PATH + { one, two }    --no output yet-- 
>>This is two lines of
input.   --no output yet-- 
>>This is two lines of
input. With a \TeX. 
and two lines of output.
output has a \TeX too.

This is right after those two.

Here is a short prompt:
>dog=$PATH + { one, two }    --no output yet-- 
And another.
>This is two lines of
input.   --no output yet-- 
And another
>This is two lines of
input. With a \TeX. 
and two lines of output.
output has a \TeX too.

That was the end of the stuff.
