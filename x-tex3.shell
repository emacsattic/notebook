Sample Fake Notebook \\

This is just to see how notebook-to-tex works.  Do try to run this.


>>dog=$PATH + { one, two }  
bash: +: command not found

>>This is two lines of
input. 
bash: This: command not found
bash: input.: command not found

>>This is two lines of
input. With a \TeX. 
bash: This: command not found
bash: input.: command not found

This is right after those two.

Here is a short prompt:
>dog=$PATH + { one, two }  
bash: +: command not found

And another.
>This is two lines of
input. 
bash: This: command not found
bash: input.: command not found

And another
>This is two lines of
input. With a \TeX. 
bash: This: command not found
bash: input.: command not found

That was the end of the stuff.
