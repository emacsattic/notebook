This is a list of things that would be nice to do.  And a few bugs that I've
been too lazy to fix.

-----------
I wrote special versions of kill and yank that check the new text for cell
markers.  If text is entered in some other way, the cell markers are not found,
and might not be in pairs.  This should be fixed.  Or there should be a clever
work around.

-----------
Document creation of functions in matlab/octave modes.  
-----------
Port to xemacs if possible.
I think this means get rid of overlays.  (Use text properties instead?)
-----------
Add a syntax table that gets turns \b and ^H into a non-whitespace character.
