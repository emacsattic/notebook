This is a list of things that would be nice to do.  And a few bugs that I've
been too lazy to fix.

-----------
I wrote special versions of kill and yank that check the new text for cell
markers.  If text is entered in some other way, the cell markers are not found,
and might not be in pairs.  This should be fixed.  Or there should be a clever
work around.

-----------
Better documentation.  Corect spilling. Complete sentences.

-----------
Clean up code: use a derived mode.  Port to xemacs if possible.
Question: should notebook be a derived mode of something, or should each other
mode just be derived from another, with notebook features added.  Like matlab
is just tex-mode with other stuff added.  

-----------
Verify that all variables are local that should be buffer local.

-----------
Figure out the difference between defvar and defconst.

-----------
Add a syntax table that gets turns \b and ^H into a non-whitespace character.

;; Set up info line.

Add this to docs:


To create a new cell, type ^C^N.  To enter a cell use M-Enter or
C-Enter. Use M-Tab to move to the next cell. Use ^C^B to enter all of
the buffer.  In matlab mode, use ^C^F to tex the buffer and ^C^V to
run xdvi. 

I've added the following to my auto-mode-alist:
 ("\\.mu$" . mupad-notebook-mode)
 ("\\.matlab$" . matlab-notebook-mode)
 ("\\.M$" . matlab-notebook-mode)
 ("\\.shell$" . notebook-mode)


(Hardly worth a separate file, I know.  But I plan to write better docs later on.)

7) Useful commands:	
	Enter current input cell, and tab to next.
	Tab to next input cell (create new one if none exists). 
	Create new input cell.
	Create output cell at point, input at mark.
