This is a list of things that would be nice to do.  And a few bugs that I've
been too lazy to fix.

-----------
What the hell is latex-insert-item.
-----------
I wrote special versions of kill and yank that check the new text for cell
markers.  If text is entered in some other way, the cell markers are not found,
and might not be in pairs.  This should be fixed.  Or there should be a clever
work around.

-----------
Better documentation.  Corect spilling. Complete sentences.

-----------
Port to xemacs if possible.

-----------
Question: should notebook be a derived mode of something, or should each other
mode just be derived from another, with notebook features added.  Like matlab
is just tex-mode with other stuff added.  

-----------
Verify that all variables  that should be buffer local are in fact local.

-----------
Add a syntax table that gets turns \b and ^H into a non-whitespace character.

-----------
Change find-cell-by-position so that it creates a new cell if the cell is
there, but it's not on the list.

-----------
Maybe have font-lock verify that the cell is there?  (read up on font-lock-mode).
