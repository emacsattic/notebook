<H1>Emacs Notebook Mode</H1>
<h3>Version 2.0</h3>
<p>
This is a simple notebook mode for 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html"> Emacs</a>. 
(Since it uses faces to change colors and read/write attributes of text, it
will not work with XEmacs.)
</p>

<p>
Notebook mode sets up a sub process that has well defined input and output
responses.
Each notebook has a collection of cells, consisting of a prompt, an
input region and an output region.  You tell Emacs to send a cell to the
process (using C-Enter or M-Enter with my default key bindings) and when the
process responds, it will paste the output in to the output region.
You can then go back and edit other cells and re-enter them.
Between the cells is regular text, which you can do with as you wish. 
</p>

<p> This is different from the standard shell mode, because you may send
several input regions at once, and the output will be sorted out and pasted
next to its corresponding input.
</p>

<p>
This idea of a notebook with cells is popular with programs such as Matlab,
Maple or Mathematica.  I use it with matlab, and then pipe the notebook through
latex, so that I can write up what I'm computing, while I compute it.
</p>


<p> Version 2.0 now uses font lock to highlight the input and output regions of
a cell.  Also, the code should be more resilient to bad files.
