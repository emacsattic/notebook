To create a new cell, type ^C^N.  To enter a cell use M-Enter or
C-Enter. Use M-Tab to move to the next cell. Use ^C^B to enter all of
the buffer.  In matlab mode, use ^C^F to tex the buffer and ^C^V to
run xdvi. 

I've added the following to my auto-mode-alist:
 ("\\.mu$" . mupad-notebook-mode)
 ("\\.matlab$" . matlab-notebook-mode)
 ("\\.M$" . matlab-notebook-mode)
 ("\\.shell$" . notebook-mode)


(Hardly worth a separate file, I know.  But I plan to write better docs later on.)
