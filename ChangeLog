	* debug-notebook.el (scratch): moved to debug-notebook, since it
	shouldn't really be in production code.

	* octave-notebook-mode.el (tex-octave-file): When creating the TeX
	file, it removed an extra character from the short prompt.  This
	is no longer done.

2002-10-19  Fred Gylys-Colwell  <fredgc@member.ams.org>

	* notebook-mode.el (nb-initialize-one-cell): Added some info to
	the overlay so that it knows what cell it is part of.
	(nb-delete-cell-and-text): delete cell from cell list when text is deleted.
	(nb-cell-part-by-position): Added a function that derived modes
	can use to figure out if point is in a cell, and which part of the
	cell it is in.
	(nb-find-cell-by-position): If the point is in a region that looks
	like a cell, but is not on the list, then a new cell is
	initialized.  This happens if you insert another file into the
	current buffer.

	-- released 1.3

	* octave-notebook-mode.el (octave-notebook-adjust-output-string):
	Modifey the format a bit so that it splits lines more
	appropriately, and deletes some of the extra white space.

	* notebook-mode.el (nb-start-process): It is now o.k. to quit
	emacs without killing the subprocess.

2002-10-15  Fred Gylys-Colwell  <fredgc@member.ams.org>

	* all code: commented out debugging statements 'scratch'.

	* notebook-mode.el (nb-adjust-input-string): The function now
	removes extra semicolons, which used to confuse bash.

2002-10-15  Fred Gylys-Colwell  <fredgc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* notebook-mode.el: Added 'notebook-to-script' which converts a
	notebook into a shell script.
