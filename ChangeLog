	* octave-notebook-mode.el (octave-notebook-adjust-output-string):
	Modifey the format a bit so that it splits lines more
	appropriately, and deletes some of the extra white space.

	* notebook-mode.el (nb-start-process): It is now o.k. to quit
	emacs without killing the subprocess.

2002-10-15  Fred Gylys-Colwell  <fredgc@member.ams.org>

	* all code: commented out debugging statements 'scratch'.

	* notebook-mode.el (nb-adjust-input-string): The function now
	removes extra semicolons, which used to confuse bash.

	* notebook-mode.el: Added 'notebook-to-script' which converts a
	notebook into a shell script.
