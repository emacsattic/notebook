	* notebook-mode.el:
	Several new text functions were added.  In particular, the file can now be
	converted to TeX, HTML or plain text with the special characters removed.

2003-02-11  Fred Gylys-Colwell  <fredgc@member.ams.org>

	* notebook-mode.el:
	This is the new version of notebook-mode.  It uses font lock highlighting for
	the text region, as well as the input and output regions.  This version has
	alot of debugging statements that will be cleaned out after some more testing.
	The other modes (octave-notebook-mode, etc) don't match this yet.

	* ChangeLog, debug-notebook.el, notebook-mode.el, samp4.shell:
	nb-next-cell and nb-create-cell now return the relevant cell.  Also,
	nb-start-process resets some prompt variables so that the output is a little
	cleaner.

2002-10-28  Fred Gylys-Colwell  <fredgc@member.ams.org>

	* notebook-mode.el (nb-start-process): Sets the terminal type to
	unknown.  This should stop /bin/ls from trying to use color. Also,
	set PROMPT_COMMAND to null, so that it doesn't mess up the output.
	(nb-create-cell): It now returns the cell that was just created.
	(nb-next-cell): It now returns the cell, or nil if one wasn't found.
	(notebook-to-script): Remove -*- notebook -*- mode from script.

2002-10-22  Fred Gylys-Colwell  <fredgc@member.ams.org>

	* debug-notebook.el (scratch): moved to debug-notebook, since it
	shouldn't really be in production code.

	* octave-notebook-mode.el (tex-octave-file): When creating the TeX
	file, it removed an extra character from the short prompt.  This
	is no longer done.

2002-10-19  Fred Gylys-Colwell  <fredgc@member.ams.org>

	* notebook-mode.el (nb-initialize-one-cell): Added some info to
	the overlay so that it knows what cell it is part of.
	(nb-delete-cell-and-text): delete cell from cell list when text is deleted.
	(nb-cell-part-by-position): Added a function that derived modes
	can use to figure out if point is in a cell, and which part of the
	cell it is in.
	(nb-find-cell-by-position): If the point is in a region that looks
	like a cell, but is not on the list, then a new cell is
	initialized.  This happens if you insert another file into the
	current buffer.

	-- released 1.3

	* octave-notebook-mode.el (octave-notebook-adjust-output-string):
	Modifey the format a bit so that it splits lines more
	appropriately, and deletes some of the extra white space.
	

2002-10-17  Fred Gylys-Colwell  <fredgc@member.ams.org>

	* notebook-mode.el (nb-start-process): It is now o.k. to quit
	emacs without killing the subprocess.

2002-10-15  Fred Gylys-Colwell  <fredgc@member.ams.org>

	* all code: commented out debugging statements 'scratch'.

	* notebook-mode.el (nb-adjust-input-string): The function now
	removes extra semicolons, which used to confuse bash.

2002-10-15  Fred Gylys-Colwell  <fredgc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* notebook-mode.el: Added 'notebook-to-script' which converts a
	notebook into a shell script.
