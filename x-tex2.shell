Sample Shell Script \\
\end{center}

This is a sample shell script.  Let $\theta = 3.2$.
Then
>>theta=3.2   
This is part of the comment text.  Now what is $\theta$.
>echo what is theta? oh.  it is $theta  
what is theta? oh. it is 3.2

Notice the following uses a short prompt.
>echo Is FDGC a keyword?   
Is FDGC a keyword?

It is embedded in the line.
>FDGC=1234   
Can the following be embedded, with it's dollar sign?
>echo FDGC =  $FDGC  
FDGC = 1234


>>  
