Emacs Notebook mode.

Notebook mode sets up a sub process that has well defined input and output
responses.  Each notebook has a collection of cells, consisting of a prompt, an
input region and an output region.  You tell Emacs to send a cell to the
process (using C-Enter or M-Enter) and when the process responds, it will paste
the output in to the output region.  You can then go back and edit other cells
and re-enter them.  Between the cells is regular text, which you can do with as
you wish. 

This idea of a notebook with cells is popular with programs such as Matlab,
Maple or Mathematica.  I use it with matlab, and then pipe the notebook through
latex.  


To create a new cell, type ^C^N.  To enter a cell use M-Enter or
C-Enter. Use M-Tab to move to the next cell. Use ^C^B to enter all of
the buffer.  In matlab mode, use ^C^F to tex the buffer and ^C^V to
run xdvi. 


I've added the following to my auto-mode-alist:
 ("\\.mu$" . mupad-notebook-mode)
 ("\\.matlab$" . matlab-notebook-mode)
 ("\\.M$" . matlab-notebook-mode)
 ("\\.shell$" . notebook-mode)


There are some sample files in this directory.
